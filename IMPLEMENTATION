DNS access
**********

As of 2012-06-21, DNS Looking Glass uses DNS Python for DNS access. It
works with the high-level interface (dns.resolver) which has several
limitations (retries when the answer is REFUSED or SERVFAIL, which is
stupid and leads to spurious timeouts, no support for ANY query type,
etc). In the future, DNS Looking Glass may switch to the low-level
interface.
